# jupyter_notebooks
A collection of notebooks i've made.

* EDA's
* Styling with Visualisations
* Machine Learning Notebooks

Not necessarily jupyter notebooks, just python notebooks in general.

Since discovering python I've been more inclined to work with notebooks, rather than full on scripts as I find them much easier to run simple pieces of code in order to then further combine them down the line.
